1. <!-- What is the difference between var, let, and const? -->

<!-- var -->

var is a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned and can be declared multiple times with the same name.

<!-- let -->

let is block scoped. It is limited to that block only
redeclaration is not allowed in the same scope
Only the value of the variable can be changed.

<!-- const -->

The value of a variable declared with const cannot be changed once it is set. It is immutable

2.  <!-- What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? -->

<!-- map() -->

Create a new array with map() where each element has the value obtained.

<!-- forEach() -->

When an action needs to be performed for each element, use forEach() unless a new array is needed.

<!-- filter() -->

filter() is used to create a new array containing only selected elements based on a condition.

3. <!-- What are arrow functions in ES6? -->

Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, provide a shorter syntax for writing functions and handle this differently than regular functions

4. <!--  How does destructuring assignment work in ES6? -->

Destructuring in ES6 is a syntax that lets you unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into separate variables, making code cleaner and more readable.

5. <!-- Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation? -->

Template literals, introduced in ES6, offer a more flexible way to work with strings using backticks (`) instead of quotes, allowing easy interpolation strings.
